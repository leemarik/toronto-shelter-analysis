abstract: "This paper analyzes the Toronto Shelter System data from Open Data Toronto. The analysis focuses on shelter usage treends, population group percentage, and demographic insights. Key findings include the distribution of shelter use across different age group, and overall shelter occupancy rate. The findings assist in understaanding the patterns of homelessness and shelter use in Toronto over time"

# Introduction

Toronto is not an exception to the rule that large cities throughout the world continues to struggle with homelessness. designing policies and programs that may effectively serve the needs of this group requires an understanding of the demographic distribution of those who rely on shelter services as well as the patterns of shelter utilization. The goal of this study is to investigate the Toronto Shelter System data set from Toronto Open Data, which offers comprehensive statistics on the city's shelter usage over time. 

Through an analysis of shelter occupancy rates among various age, gender, and population categories, important insights on the dynamics of shelter use in Toronto can be obtained. Important trends will also be highlighted by this analysis, including which demographics are most vulnerable to homelessness and how shelter capacity varies.


# Data {#sec-data}

This analysis uses data from Toronto Open Data (@fig-shelter). The dataset includes shelter occupancy trends, broken down by age group, gender, and other demographic factors. The goal of this analysis is to provide insight into shelter usage patterns in Toronto, helping policymakers understand the population groups most affected by homelessness.

```

Talk way more about it. 



# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.


# Results
